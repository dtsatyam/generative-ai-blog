# Chapter 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Introduction
Neural networks form the backbone of modern deep learning and artificial intelligence. Inspired by the human brain, they have revolutionized fields such as natural language processing, computer vision, and autonomous systems. This chapter lays the foundation for understanding neural networks and deep learning, explaining fundamental concepts, architectures, and key techniques used in training models effectively.

## What You Will Learn
In this chapter, we will cover:
- The basics of neural networks, including perceptrons and activation functions.
- How feedforward neural networks process data and make predictions.
- The role of backpropagation and gradient descent in training neural networks.
- Common loss functions and their impact on learning.
- Optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, and RMSprop to enhance model performance.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a strong grasp of neural network fundamentals and be well-prepared for more advanced topics in deep learning.
